### Problem Statement I: Evaluation Tool for LLM based Solutions

### Description: Evaluating the performance of LLM based solutions is crucial for ensuring their reliability and quality. Manual human evaluation is time consuming, expensive, and subject to variability. 

### Details: Develop an evaluation tool to evaluate LLM based applications accurately and efficiently. The tool should simplify LLM evaluation and reduce manual efforts by providing reliable metrics and insights to developers. Results of the tool should be aligned with manual human evaluation. By focusing on various evaluation aspects, including RAG (retrieval augmented generation) based solutions, the tool will streamline the evaluation process.

Example features: (These are ideas to inspire your development and do not need to necessarily be implemented)
RAG-based solution focus
Human-like evaluation
Customizable evaluation criteria
Benchmarking and comparison
Integration with development pipeline
